<p>This project is a workout timer. The person exercising has a goal of ten workouts per week.</p>
<p>The aerobics choices have a warm-up, then five, one minute intervals that increase either speed or incline. After these five, the top one is repeated and then intervals decline ending with a cool-down.</p>
<p>The weight choices have a warm-up and cool-down as well. However, the intervals are an increase of weight with a decrease of the weight. Then after the increase has maxed, the repetitions are then deceased.</p>
